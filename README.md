# THREE.js MIDI Visualizer

>[!WARNING]
> This is a pre-alpha, work-in-progress project. Not intended for use.

A lightweight, work-in-progress MIDI Visualizer. Currently in the barebones pre-alpha state, but somewhat functional.
End goal is a fully-fleged user application for content creation with 3D Particles, simple fluid simulation for smoke, keyframeable properties, real-time recording, MIDI file reading, etc. etc. All the cool stuff.

Currently supports: 
- MIDI device connection and playing
- Renderer hybridization -- automatically switches between WebGL or WebGPU on page load depending on availability.
- Responsive design: although you can't see it yet, the note transformation and keyboard generation functions are designed to work with various key sizes.
- A simple placeholder UI
